# Multi-Step Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with LSTM.
Codes are fully developed in Google Colab including training and validation.
It's a base example of how dataset are prepared to train in LSTM model.
Feel free to use it for your project, you will need to input your own dataset.
The n_steps_in and n_step_out can be re-defined by user depends on the application. 
Number of hidden layers and units can be also defined for better forecasting.
